# 3442. Maximum Difference Between Even and Odd Frequency I

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Your task is to find the maximum difference diff = freq(a1) - freq(a2) between the frequency of characters a1 and a2 in the string such that:

a1 has an odd frequency in the string.
a2 has an even frequency in the string.
Return this maximum difference.

 

> **Example 1**
> 
> Input: s = "aaaaabbc"
> 
> Output: 3
> 
> Explanation:
> 
> The character 'a' has an odd frequency of 5, and 'b' has an even frequency of 2.
> 
> The maximum difference is 5 - 2 = 3.

> **Example 2**
> 
> Input: s = "abcabcab"
> 
> Output: 1
> 
> Explanation:
> 
> The character 'a' has an odd frequency of 3, and 'c' has an even frequency of 2.
> 
> The maximum difference is 3 - 2 = 1.


### Solution
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxDifference(string s) {
        map<int,int> temp;
        int a = 0;
        int b = INT_MAX;
        for(auto c:s){
            temp[c]++;
        }
        for(auto c:s){
            if(temp[c]%2==1 && temp[c]>a) a = temp[c];
            else if(temp[c]%2==0 && temp[c]<b) b = temp[c];
        }
        cout << a <<endl;
        cout << b <<endl;
        return (a-b);
    }
};

```
