# 2071. Maximum Number of Tasks You Can Assign


You have n tasks and m workers. Each task has a strength requirement stored in a 0-indexed integer array tasks, with the ith task requiring tasks[i] strength to complete. The strength of each worker is stored in a 0-indexed integer array workers, with the jth worker having workers[j] strength. Each worker can only be assigned to a single task and must have a strength greater than or equal to the task's strength requirement (i.e., workers[j] >= tasks[i]).

Additionally, you have pills magical pills that will increase a worker's strength by strength. You can decide which workers receive the magical pills, however, you may only give each worker at most one magical pill.

Given the 0-indexed integer arrays tasks and workers and the integers pills and strength, return the maximum number of tasks that can be completed.

 

> **Example 1**
> 
> Input: tasks = [3,2,1], workers = [0,3,3], pills = 1, strength = 1
> 
> Output: 3
> 
> Explanation:
> 
> We can assign the magical pill and tasks as follows:
> 
> - Give the magical pill to worker 0.
> 
> - Assign worker 0 to task 2 (0 + 1 >= 1)
> 
> - Assign worker 1 to task 1 (3 >= 2)
> 
> - Assign worker 2 to task 0 (3 >= 3)

> **Example 2**
> 
> Input: tasks = [5,4], workers = [0,0,0], pills = 1, strength = 5
> 
> Output: 1
> 
> Explanation:
> 
> We can assign the magical pill and tasks as follows:
> 
> - Give the magical pill to worker 0.
> 
> - Assign worker 0 to task 0 (0 + 5 >= 5)

> **Example 3**
> 
> Input: tasks = [10,15,30], workers = [0,10,10,10,10], pills = 3, strength = 10
> 
> Output: 2
> 
> Explanation:
> 
> We can assign the magical pills and tasks as follows:
> 
> - Give the magical pill to worker 0 and worker 1.
> 
> - Assign worker 0 to task 0 (0 + 10 >= 10)
> 
> - Assign worker 1 to task 1 (10 + 10 >= 15)
> 
> The last pill is not given because it will not make any worker strong enough for the last task.



### Solution
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool canAssign(int k, vector<int>& tasks, vector<int>& workers, int pills, int strength) {
        multiset<int> workerSet(workers.end() - k, workers.end());  // 강한 worker만 고려
        int pillsLeft = pills;

        for (int i = k - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            int task = tasks[i];
            auto it = workerSet.lower_bound(task);
            if (it != workerSet.end()) {
                // 약 안 먹이고 가능
                workerSet.erase(it);
            } else {
                // 약을 먹이고라도 가능한 worker를 찾아야 함
                if (pillsLeft == 0) return false;
                auto it2 = workerSet.lower_bound(task - strength);
                if (it2 == workerSet.end()) return false;
                workerSet.erase(it2);
                pillsLeft--;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }

    int maxTaskAssign(vector<int>& tasks, vector<int>& workers, int pills, int strength) {
        sort(tasks.begin(), tasks.end());
        sort(workers.begin(), workers.end());

        int left = 0, right = min((int)tasks.size(), (int)workers.size());
        int answer = 0;
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = (left + right) / 2;
            if (canAssign(mid, tasks, workers, pills, strength)) {
                answer = mid;
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return answer;
    }
};
```
