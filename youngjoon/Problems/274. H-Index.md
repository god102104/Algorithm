# 274. H-Index

Given an array of integers citations where citations[i] is the number of citations a researcher received for their ith paper, return the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: The h-index is defined as the maximum value of h such that the given researcher has published at least h papers that have each been cited at least h times.

 

> **Example 1**
> 
> Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
> 
> Output: 3
> 
> Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.
Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.


> **Example 2**
> 
> Input: citations = [1,3,1]
> 
> Output: 1


### Solution 

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int hIndex(vector<int>& citations) {
        int cnt = 0;
        sort(citations.begin(),citations.end());
        reverse(citations.begin(),citations.end());
        for(int i=0; i<citations.size(); i++){
            if(citations[i]-i-1>=0) cnt ++;
        }
        return cnt;
    }
};
```

Time complexity : O(NlogN) + O(NlogN) + O(N)

Space complexitiy : O(1)

설명 필요 X, 

하지만 Sort 를 `Merge sort`나 `Quick sort` 등으로 직접 작성하는 것을 고려 하자.
