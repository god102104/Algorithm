# 543. Diameter of Binary Tree

Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.

The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

> 
> Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5]
> 
> Output: 3
> 
> Explanation: 3 is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].


> **Example 2**
> 
> Input: root = [1,2]
> 
> Output: 1


Diameter를 어떻게 구해야할지 몰라서 시간초과함.

### Solution 

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
int result = 0;
    int diameterOfBinaryTree(TreeNode* root) {
        int diameter = 0;
        DFS(root, diameter);
        return diameter;
    }
    int DFS(TreeNode* root,int & diameter){
        if (!root) {
            return 0;
        }
        int leftHeight = DFS(root->left, diameter);
        int rightHeight = DFS(root->right, diameter);

        diameter = std::max(diameter, leftHeight + rightHeight);
        return std::max(leftHeight, rightHeight) + 1;
    }
};
```

그냥 왼쪽 subtree와 오른쪽 subtree의 길이를 더해주면된다.
