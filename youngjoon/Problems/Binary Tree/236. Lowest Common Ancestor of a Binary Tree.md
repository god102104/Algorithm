# 236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree

Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

> Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1

> Output: 3

> Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.

> Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4
> 
> Output: 5
> 
> Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.

### Solution
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode* root, TreeNode* p, TreeNode* q) {
        if (!root || root == p || root == q)
            return root;

        TreeNode* left = lowestCommonAncestor(root->left, p, q);
        TreeNode* right = lowestCommonAncestor(root->right, p, q);

        if (left && right) return root; // 양쪽에서 하나씩 찾았을 때 현재 노드가 LCA
        return left ? left : right;     // 둘 중 하나만 존재하면 존재하는 쪽 반환
    }
};
 ```
