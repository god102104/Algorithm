# 695. Max Area of Island

You are given an m x n binary matrix grid. An island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

The area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island.

Return the maximum area of an island in grid. If there is no island, return 0.

> 
> Input: grid = [[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
> 
> Output: 6
> 
> Explanation: The answer is not 11, because the island must be connected 4-directionally.

> **Example 2**
> 
> Input: grid = [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
> 
> Output: 0


### Solution(BFS)

```cpp
    class Solution {
    public:
        int maxAreaOfIsland(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
            int maxval = 0;
            int m = grid.size(), n = grid[0].size();
            queue<pair<int,int>> q;
            vector<pair<int,int>> directions = {{-1,0},{0,1},{0,-1},{1,0}};

            for(int i = 0; i < m; i++){
                for(int j = 0; j < n; j++){
                    if(grid[i][j] == 1){
                        int cnt = 0;
                        grid[i][j] = 0;
                        q.push({i, j});
                        
                        while(!q.empty()){
                            auto [x, y] = q.front(); q.pop();
                            cnt++;

                            for(auto [dx, dy] : directions){
                                int nx = x + dx, ny = y + dy;
                                if(nx >= 0 && nx < m && ny >= 0 && ny < n && grid[nx][ny] == 1){
                                    grid[nx][ny] = 0; // 방문 처리
                                    q.push({nx, ny});
                                }
                            }
                        }
                        maxval = max(maxval, cnt);
                    }
                }
            }

            return maxval;
        }
    };
```

BFS로 푼 풀이, 나중에 DFS로도 풀자
