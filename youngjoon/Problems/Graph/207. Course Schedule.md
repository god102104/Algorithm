# 207. Course Schedule

There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1. You are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that you must take course bi first if you want to take course ai.

For example, the pair [0, 1], indicates that to take course 0 you have to first take course 1.
Return true if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return false.

 

> **Example 1**
> 
> Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
> 
> Output: true
> 
> Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
> 
> To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.


> **Example 2**
> 
> Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
> 
> Output: false
> 
> Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
> 
> To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.


### Solution(Topological sort)
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool canFinish(int numCourses, vector<vector<int>>& prerequisites) {
        // Create adjacency list representation of the graph
        vector<vector<int>> graph(numCourses);
        // In-degree vector to count prerequisites (incoming edges) for each course
        vector<int> inDegree(numCourses, 0);

        // Build the graph and populate in-degrees
        for (const auto& prereq : prerequisites) {
            graph[prereq[1]].push_back(prereq[0]);
            inDegree[prereq[0]]++;
        }

        // Use a queue to store courses with no prerequisites (in-degree = 0)
        queue<int> q;
        for (int i = 0; i < numCourses; i++) {
            if (inDegree[i] == 0) {
                q.push(i);
            }
        }

        // Counter to track the number of courses we are able to process
        int processedCourses = 0;

        while (!q.empty()) {
            int course = q.front();
            q.pop();
            processedCourses++;

            // For every course that this course is a prerequisite for, reduce in-degree
            for (int nextCourse : graph[course]) {
                inDegree[nextCourse]--;
                // If in-degree becomes 0, add it to the queue
                if (inDegree[nextCourse] == 0) {
                    q.push(nextCourse);
                }
            }
        }

        // If we processed all courses, it means we can finish all courses
        return processedCourses == numCourses;
    }
};
```
