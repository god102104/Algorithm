# 207. Course Schedule

There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1. You are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that you must take course bi first if you want to take course ai.

For example, the pair [0, 1], indicates that to take course 0 you have to first take course 1.
Return true if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return false.

 

Example 1:

Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
Example 2:

Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.


### Solution 
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool canFinish(int numCourses, vector<vector<int>>& prerequisites) {
        vector<vector<int>> graph(numCourses);
        vector<int> inDegree(numCourses, 0);

        for (const auto& pre : prerequisites) {
            graph[pre[1]].push_back(pre[0]);
            inDegree[pre[0]]++; 
        }
        queue<int> q;
        for (int i = 0; i < numCourses; i++) {
            if (inDegree[i] == 0) {
                q.push(i);
            }
        }

        int count = 0;
        while (!q.empty()) {
            int course = q.front();
            q.pop();
            count++;

            for (int next : graph[course]) {
                inDegree[next]--;
                if (inDegree[next] == 0) {
                    q.push(next);
                }
            }
        }
        return count == numCourses;
    }
};
